# TronGame
A Tron light cycle game for 2 players in Java using libgdx for the UTPB ACM Halloween Carnival.
The goal is to implement a 2-player game similar to this: http://www.fltron.com/

# Getting Started Contributing
This game is built using the [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html) Java game development framework.

To set up a libgdx development environment, please follow the tutorial found [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation.html). There is also a useful tutorial for learning the ropes of libgdx [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game).

Once you have that set up, fork and clone the repository and begin implementing one of the classes in the Tron-Lightbikes-core folder that are left to build.

Once you are finished with a significant change, please submit a pull request and we will merge it after review.
